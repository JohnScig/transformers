## Create Database
Please run the CompanyHierarchyScript_JohnScig.sql in Microsoft SQL Studio. Run the script - it will create a database.

## Change Database Path
In the project, change the path to database. 

It is set in 'DatabaseCommunication -> Properties -> Settings1.Settings on the ConnString setting.

Change that to 'Server = **{SET YOUR SERVER PATH HERE}**; Database = CompanyHierarchy; Trusted_Connection = True;'

You can find your server path in SQL Management Studio if you right-click on your database name on the left-most window and check Properties

## Reinstall Nugget

For a reason beyond my understanding, the NUGGET used to generate random names doesn't always re-download. If that is the case, please download 'RandomNameGeneratorLibrary' by Mark Rogers for correct functioning of the program.

If the Nugget isn't installed, the generation of random names will not work (which is not exactly a part of the assignmentm but whatevs).

## Run The Program
Now you should be able to run the program.
